<h2 class="mt-4">Summer & Rapid Tournament Rules</h2>

<li>The Summer Tournament is a time handicap tournament. Each player is allocated a computer-generated time based on previous performances. For Rapidplay, the time for each player is set to 30 minutes without increment.</li>
<li>The hand that moves the pieces must also press the clock. Clock 'covering' is therefore <b>not</b> allowed.</li>
<li>In the event of dispute, stop the clock and seek assistance from the Tournament Secretary. In his absence, another Committee Member will arbitrate.</li>
<li>You <b>cannot</b> enter the tournament unless you have paid the tournament fee</li>
<li>Insufficient material for a checkmate constitutes a draw and can be claimed as such.</li>
<li>Spectators/participants must not speak or otherwise interfere in a game other than their own and must never draw attention to a flag fall or illegal move.</li>
<li>Play shall be governed by the spirit of the Laws of Chess, i.e. in an ethical manner and in the spirit of fair play. Also please do not use excessive force in pressing the clock button.</li>
<li>All results must be marked up on the completion of each game. Failure to mark up results can and will result in the said games having to be played again.</li>
<li>In the event of arbitration, the Tournament Secretary's decision will be final and binding.</li>
</ul>
